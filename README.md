# Event Signup REST API

Small project I created to learn and practice building a REST API with a PostgreSQL backend.

## Project Overview
The idea behind this project is to allow posting events—specifically protests—and enable users to sign up for them while remaining anonymous.  

### Features
- **Event Creation & Listing**
- **Anonymous Signups**
- **Key-Based Row Removal**: Each event has a unique key for row removal

## Status
Functionality-wise, the project is mostly complete. I might make some changes or improvements later.  

## Tech Stack
- Java / Spring Boot (Controller & REST API)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
